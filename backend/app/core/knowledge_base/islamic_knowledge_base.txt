## The Quran
The Quran is the holy book of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the word of God (Allah) revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) through the angel Gabriel over a period of approximately 23 years. It is divided into chapters called surahs, and each surah is composed of verses called ayats.

## The Five Pillars of Islam
The Five Pillars of Islam are the fundamental practices of Muslim life:
1.  **Shahada (Declaration of Faith):** Declaring that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad is His servant and messenger.
2.  **Salat (Prayer):** Performing the five daily prayers facing the Kaaba in Mecca.
3.  **Zakat (Charity):** Giving a portion of one's wealth to the needy.
4.  **Sawm (Fasting of Ramadan):** Abstaining from food, drink, and intimate relations from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramadan.
5.  **Hajj (Pilgrimage to Mecca):** Performing the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in one's lifetime, if physically and financially able.

## The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
The Prophet Muhammad (570-632 CE) is considered the last prophet sent by God in Islam. His life and teachings are documented in the Sunnah.

## The Sunnah
The Sunnah comprises the sayings, actions, and tacit approvals of the Prophet Muhammad. It is the second source of legislation in Islam after the Quran.
